## About me

Senior Full Stack Cloud developer with a passion for architecture and data projects.

## Currently working on

### Node Automation Hat

Node Automation Hat is a npm package (found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/automation-hat)) which I reverse engineered from the
Pimoroni [Automation Hat Python library](https://github.com/pimoroni/automation-hat). This was so I could use the Pimoroni
[Automation Hat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat) hardware in projects.

This project is open source and can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/automation-hat).

### Pi Garage

Is a complete system to make a garage door into a smart garage door. This comprises of a mobile app (Android & iOS) and a
docker backend service that can be ran on a Raspberry Pi with a Pimoroni Automation Hat.

The project is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/michaelgambold/pi-garage).
